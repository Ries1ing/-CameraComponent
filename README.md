This aims to address several areas, the first one being a foundational recap of the background theory of statistics/probably, machine learning and neural networks. Whilst I have had a moderate chunk of experience in these areas within my degree and job, there are holes and rusty parts of my knowledge. Before starting more advanced courses, I think would make sense to recap the theory that most of these courses build
