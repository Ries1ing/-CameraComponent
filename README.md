# My Degree - Full-Stack Data Science

## Introduction

  As a data scientist with *"only"* a bachelor’s in Physics and Mathematics, I have the feeling that I have reached the frontiers of my current knowledge. To prevent stagnation in my long-term growth, I have designed this curriculum.

This aims to address several areas, the first one being a foundational recap of the background theory of statistics/probably, machine learning and neural networks. Whilst I have had a moderate chunk of experience in these areas within my degree and job, there are holes and rusty parts of my knowledge. Before starting more advanced courses, I think would make sense to recap the theory that most of these courses build upon.

The second centre of attention will focus much more on technical skills. It is fine having strong theory but implementing the theory is a whole other beast. I think that technical skill is an important area to master. Most of the time, this is what a business will care the most about. Whilst I believe my technical skill to be at a decent level, there are definite deficiencies in my level experience. To be clear, however, I am not a beginner in my abilities. The areas that will take the spotlight are:
- General data engineering
- MLOps
- General cloud platform knowhow
- Tensorflow/PyTorch
- Software engineering principles

Software engineering principles may appear to be a strange addition to this list - (anecdotally) many data scientists do not focus
